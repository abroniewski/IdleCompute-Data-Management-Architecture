Open Nebula login with:
	user: masterBD12
	password: asY76fkG12

Once in the dashboard, setup VM (press green +, name machine, keep default settings)
	password: asY76fkG12

In local terminal: to connect and interact with VM. ip address can be found in the OpenNebula dashboard. This will turn this instance of your local terminal into the VM terminal.
Make sure the VM status is "running" in Open Nebula.
We will setup 2 of the VMs in the instructions. We will need to do the same for all of the rest
ssh bdm@host_ip_address

	ssh bdm@10.4.41.37 
	passowrd: bdm
	ssh bdm@10.4.41.64
	passowrd: asY76fkG12

In terminal go to root directory
	cd /etc
	sudo vi hosts	-> the file is read only, so we need superuser permissions
	i		-> this will enter insert mode in the "hosts" file
	add the following two lines:
10.4.41.64 hdp-master
10.4.41.37 hdp-slave-1
	press ESC and then :x to save the file
	complete the same steps in the other VM


If you have made changes and want to save the file, press :x (again you must not be in Insert mode. If you are, press ESC to leave it).
If you haven't made any changes, press :q to leave the file (but you must not be in Insert mode).
If you have made changes, but want to leave the file without saving the changes, press :q! (but you must not be in Insert mode).
